#scheduleGuru: a unique business problem that is not spiraling out of control

this is what i tell myself "everything's fine - don't worry about those features creeping in from everywhere.  totes-magotes!"

##Laravel is to blame

"hey, you haven't used php since 5.2 but laravel is all the rage on the streets - lets do this!"

aaaaaand...
i have
 *  a full working knowledge of oauth2 and the google-php-apis (past and present), 
 * a honest feeling of understanding and empowerment with my ability to do anything in php, 
 * a php framework i really, really like
 * a f@#$ing beard


if i knew where he lived, i'd probably toiletpaper andrewelkins's house for keeping the fire going on  [laravel4-starter-kit](https://github.com/andrewelkins/laravel4-starter-kit)

IMHO [laracasts](https://laracasts.com) are simply amazing. IMHO jeff, taylor, and the merry bands of laravel evangelists are genuinely changing the game for php


## Features

* more
* to
* come
