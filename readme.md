#scheduleGuru: a unique business problem that is not spiraling out of control

this is what happens when you decide to slow-cook a interesting new project with some spiceyness by throwing in a dash of learning a new framework. 'hey, you haven't used php since 5.2 but laravel seems pretty cool - lets do this!'

aaaaaand...
i have
 *  a full working knowledge of oauth2 and the google-php-apis (past and present), 
 * a honest feeling of understanding and empowerment with my ability to do anything in php, 
 * a php framework i really, really like
 * a f@#$ing beard


if i knew where he lived, i'd probably toiletpaper andrewelkins's house for keeping the fire going on  [laravel4-starter-kit](https://github.com/andrewelkins/laravel4-starter-kit)

IMHO [laracasts](https://laracasts.com) are way too helpful; IMHO jeff way and the pillars of the hand in laravel are genuinely changing the game for php.
