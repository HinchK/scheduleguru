##Laravel has brought me back to PHP

"hey, you haven't used php since 5.2 but laravel is all the rage on the streets - lets do this!"

5 months later i have
 * a honest feeling of understanding and empowerment with my ability to do anything in php, 
 * a framework i have fun working in,
 * a pretty terrible beard


andrewelkins's starter-kit helped me out a lot starting out; his installation and set-up instructions are just terrific for noobs
[laravel4-starter-kit](https://github.com/andrewelkins/laravel4-starter-kit)

IMHO [laracasts](https://laracasts.com) are simply amazing. IMHO jeff, taylor, and the merry bands of laravel evangelists are genuinely changing the game for php
